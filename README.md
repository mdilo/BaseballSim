This is my attempt at simulating a baseball at bat, game, series, season, or more.

Currently working on simulating an at bat using psudo data and rates.

Eventually work in databases with real data.

WORK LOG:
[2/16] - Got all functions working with fake data. Need to think about how to incorporate strike zone and rates of pitches in/out of the zone. Eventually work in real numbers.
