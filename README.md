# Baseball Simulation

This is my attempt at simulating a baseball at bat, game, series, season, or more to learn python.

Currently working on simulating an at bat using psudo data and rates.

Eventually work in databases with real data.

WORK LOG:

[2/16] - Got all functions working with fake data. Need to think about how to incorporate strike zone and rates of pitches in/out of the zone. Eventually work in real numbers. 

[2/17] - Created read.py to read in lahman pitcher and people data. 
TODO:
 Figure out math for batter batting avg and pitcher "opposing batting avg"
 Create simple simulation with these averages 
 
 [2/21] - created a batter simulation using real data. Simulate a whole season of at bats and count 1b 2b 3b hr
